# oblig4-reaction-and-insanity

In this folder, I had to delete node_module in both folders (Reaction & inSanity - trying to be original & give a unique file name) 
and send all the assignments as a ZIP-file due to the large proportions and I had run in with so much trouble. I suppose you can 
use npm install to fetch the node_module on both folders. 

Not sure if I have done this correctly, hopefully there will be less of a hack next time. 

Måtte slette isåfall node_modules pga. at det ble super stort og jeg synes jeg husker så vidt at det ble nevnt på forelesning at man skulle slette node_modules tenkt jeg. 
Det har vært en krøll med noe filer, og håper at alt fungerer som det skal. :)
